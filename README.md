# :star: Daily Coding Challenges
Hi, I'm Ron. I created this repository as a way to track my progress on codewars.com and share my solutions with others. 

# :fire: Goal
* Coding challenges have been a great way to solve puzzles in my free time at work. 
* I'm learning more about the fundamentals of Javascript in bite-sized pieces.
* Competition with other 100devs cohort members!
* Practical repetition.

# :paper: Notes
I will be commenting names of each kata as I solve them for the day. 
Katas will be organized in folders by difficulty levels.
I am not a coding genius. These solutions are messy.
As my Javascript gets better, I hope to refactor old problems, though my ADHD will probably make me forget about this promise.
