# Daily Coding Challenges
Hi, I'm Ron. I created this repository as a way to track my progress on codewars.com and share my solutions with others. 

# Goal
* Coding challenges have been a great way to solve puzzles in my free time at work. 
* I'm learning more about the fundamentals of Javascript in bite-sized pieces.
* Competition with other 100devs cohort members!
* Practical repetition.

# Notes
I will be commenting names of each kata as I solve them for the day. 
Katas will be organized in folders by difficulty levels.

# Codewars Stats
Current level: 7 kyu.
